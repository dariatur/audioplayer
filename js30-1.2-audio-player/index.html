            <p class="lyrics">Please don't try to find me through my dealer
He won't pick up his phone
Please don't try my father either
He ain't been home for years
I know I'm no spirit seeker
I can't sleep through the tears
I get lost in the ether
I check it, I wreck it, I turn it around
I gave you all my money, gave you all my money
Gave you all my money, gave you all my money
I don't wanna live
I don't wanna give you nothing
'Cause you never give me nothing back
Why can't you be good for something?
Not one shirt off your back
Why can't you be good for something?
Not one shirt off your back
Please don't try to find me through my dealer
He won't pick up his phone
Please don't try my doctor either
He won't take any calls
He's no fucking spirit healer
He just can't stop to talk
But he's gone now for the weekend
I check it, I wreck it, I turn it around
I gave you all my money, gave you all my money
Gave you all my money, gave you all my money
I don't wanna live
I don't wanna give you nothing
'Cause you never give me nothing back
Why can't you be good for something?
Not one shirt off your back
Why can't you be good for something?
Not one shirt off your back
please don't
(9275, 555) try to find me through my dealer
(Now you've got a busy time) he won't pick up his phone
(All circuits are busy, goodbye)
(All circuits are busy, you're high) please don't try my father either
(All circuits are busy, goodbye)
(All circuits are busy, you're high) he ain't been home for years
            </p>
            <p class="lyrics">When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here

            <p class="lyrics">You're talking shit for the hell of it
                Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
                You're terrified to look down
                'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
                Of everyone you burned just to get there
                It's coming back around
                And I keep my side of the street clean
                You wouldn't know what I mean
                'Cause karma is my boyfriend
                Karma is a god
                Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
                Karma's a relaxing thought
                Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
                Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
                Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
                Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
                Me and karma vibe like that
                Spider-boy, king of thieves
                Weave your little webs of opacity
                My pennies made your crown
                Trick me once, trick me twice
                Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?
                It's coming back around
                And I keep my side of the street clean
                You wouldn't know what I mean
                'Cause karma is my boyfriend
                Karma is a god
                Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
                Karma's a relaxing thought
                Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
                Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
                Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
                Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
                Me and karma vibe like that
                Ask me what I learned from all those years
                Ask me what I earned from all those tears
                Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here
                (I'm still, I'm still here)
                'Cause karma is the thunder
                Rattling your ground
                Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter
                Karma's gonna track you down
                Step by step from town to town
                Sweet like justice, karma is a queen
                Karma takes all my friends to the summit
                Karma is the guy on the screen
                Coming straight home to me
                'Cause karma is my boyfriend (karma is my boyfriend)
                Karma is a god
                Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend (weekend)
                Karma's a relaxing thought
                Aren't you envious that for you it's not?

                You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
                I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
                And I swear too much on the regular
                We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go
                If it ain't XO then it gotta go
                I just won a new award for a kids show
                Talkin' 'bout a face numbin' off a bag of blow
                I'm like goddamn bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
                Goddamn bitch, I am not a bleach boy
                Whip game, make a nigga understand though
                Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
                Hit the gas so hard make it rotate (rotate)
                All my niggas blew up like a propane (propane)
                All these R&B niggas be so lame

                Said I'm just tryna swim in somethin' wetter than the ocean
                Faded off a double cup, I'm mixin' up the potion
                All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
                It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
                Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
                Platinum off a mixtape, sippin' on that codeine
                Pour it in my trophies, rollin' 'til my nose bleed
                I'ma keep on singin' while I'm burnin' up that OG
                All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
                Rock a chain around they neck, makin' sure I'm gettin' home
                When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
                And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
                Used to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
                Now my shit straight
                Eatin' all day, tryna lose weight
                That good sex, we'll sweat it out
                Hotel bedsprings we'll wear it out
                I ain't gotta tell you 'cause

            <p class="lyrics">Met my boyfriend down at the taco truck
                Pass me my vape, I'm feeling sick, I need to take a puff
                Imagine if we actually gave a fuck
                Wouldn't that be something to talk about for us?
                Caribbean blue in sweater weather
                I'm fallin' into you
                Although it seems I've gotten better
                I can be violent too
                That's why they call me Lanita
                When I get down like bonita
                Don't come find me in Reseda
                I'll go crazy
                Read my gold chain, says, "Lanita"
                When I'm violent, it's Carlito's Way
                Blood on my feet on the street
                I'm dancin' crazy
                Spin it 'til you whip it into a cream, baby
                Print it into black and white pages, don't faze me
                Before you talk, let me stop what you're saying
                I know, I know, I know that you hate me
                Honey, I got up so early
                And then, I got into the shower
                I was just able to go back to sleep for a hour and a half
                So that rocked, um, anyway
                I had this dream where, um, I don't know
                (Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss)
                You heard my baby's back in town now
                You should come, come over
                We'll be hanging around now
                You should come, come over
                Back, back to the garden
                We're gettin' high now because we're older

            <p class="lyrics">On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say
"Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year)
You can find it here"
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
She calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain
Please bring me my wine
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here
Since 1969"
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say
"Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis"
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said, "We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device"
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
"Relax, " said the night man
"We are programmed to receive
You can check-out any time you like
But you can never leave!"
            </p>
            <p class="lyrics">Imagine there's no heaven
                It's easy if you try

                Imagine all the people
                Livin' for today
                Ah
                Imagine there's no countries
                It isn't hard to do
                Nothing to kill or die for
                And no religion, too
                Imagine all the people

                Imagine no possessions
                I wonder if you can
                No need for greed or hunger
                A brotherhood of man
                Imagine all the people
                Sharing all the world
                You
                You may say I'm a dreamer
                But I'm not the only one

                Just a piece of leg to bite on
                What a night to fly my kite on

                Take a look, it's on display for you
                Coming down, no, not today
                Did you meet your fortune teller
                Get it off with no propeller
                Do it up, it's on with Stella
                What a way to finally smell her
                Pick it up, but not too strong for you
                Take a piece and pass it on
                Fly away on my zephyr
